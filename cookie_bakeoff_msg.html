<ol type="1">
    <li>Choose a cookie recipe for another participant to bake. It should be festive, but doesn't need to be edible. The recipe can be challenging, but we're on a time limit, so please nothing that would require 8 hours of chilling beforehand</li>
    <li>By <b>Tuesday December 13</b>, send your chosen baker the cookie recipe by replying in the group chat</li>
    <li>Your recipe santa should also provide a recipe for you by this time. Once you've recieved your recipe, make sure to get all required ingredients by the commencement of bake-off</li>
    <li>On Sunday December 18 @ 1 PM, we bake! We'll have 1.5 hours allotted for baking. If there are a lot of prep steps you can start some of those ahead of time.</li>
